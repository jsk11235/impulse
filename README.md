## What is this?
This will hopefully be a working minimalist text editor that works like Vim. It displays text on a screen, which you can scroll with up/down arrows, edit, save, load, etc. It also will be able to match brackets with stacks (hence, DrBracket)

## Launch
`javac Woo.java && java Woo [filename]`

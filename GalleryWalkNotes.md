# Gallery Walk notes

## AKH + D
Comments:
* Interesting to see how the "typing" was simulated, by a manually built `delay()` function instead of `Thread.sleep()`
* Am confused about the structure of their directories, it seems a bit unclean. But it makes enough sense to put them all in one directory to avoid issues during linking nodes.
* Creating a `Scanny` class was pretty cool, and easy to call (two lines)
* 

Questions:
* What is `cliff.jpg` used for?

Comments
* The UI was amazing, actually the cleanest I've seen by far in this period
* Many arraylists were used (possibly in place of other datastructures)
* I liked the clean structure of their working directory (Ball class, cushion class, pocket class)
* A lot of math involved for the collision physics, especially against round objects
* Sound effects were nice
* Apparently the icon of the processing app is jimin?

Questions:
* Why did you use miles per hour as a unit of velocity?
* ***WHY THE TALOS FONT?!?!?!?!?!?!?***

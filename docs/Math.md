# Math
Impulse, being a math-oriented language, has a number of built-in operators that can be used to perform mathematical operations.

## Addition
The `+` operator is used to add two numbers together.

Example:
```ipl
print 1+1
```

## Subtraction
The `-` operator is used to subtract one number from another.

Example:
```ipl
print 7-3
```

## Multiplication
The `*` operator is used to multiply two numbers together.

Example:
```ipl
print 2*2
```

## Division
The `/` operator is used to divide one number by another.
    
Example:
```ipl
print 8/2
```

## Exponentiation
The `^` operator is used to raise one number to the power of another.
    
Example:
```ipl
print 2^3
```

## Modulus
The `%` operator is used to find the remainder of one number divided by another.

Example:
```ipl
print 10%3
```
